# Dom 6 Dwarf Faction
Adds Dwarves to the Late Age.

Built using the [DomCompiler](https://github.com/Ryxali/DomCompiler).

## Features
Adds 'Dûn, Federated Clans' as a playable nation in the Late Age.
Adds 'The Red Ravagers' as a mercenary band in the Late Age.

## Dûn, Federated Clans
A nation that boasts exceptional, but resource intensive, equipment for its' mainline troops. Some clan members can only be recruited in highlands and mountains, or in non-forted forests, highlands, and mountains.
The nation is almost entirely secular, with very limited sacred and priest recruitment.
Mainline mages suffer from homesickness, making lengthy campaigns difficult with its' slow-moving army.

The nation has a couple of custom events, related to smithing and general quarrels between the clans. It also features a nation-specific spell only castable by the cap-only Smith Elder that transforms it into a mighty non-homesick caster.

## The Red Ravagers
A band of Redbeard Warriors lead by Rotgar.
