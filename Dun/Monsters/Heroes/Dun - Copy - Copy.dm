#name "Silver-laden"
#fixedname "Teyrgrin"
#descr "Forged before the time of recordkeeping, Teyrgrin had kept himself in a long slumber. Since he was the crowning achievement of the earthly realm he had no interest in it. Nothing to gain, nothing to learn. But he did more than sleep, he dreamt - dreamt of the infinite possibilities beyond earth and flesh, beyond the innumerable possibilities of the void.

Now Teyrgrin has awoken from his dreams, ready to make those dreams come manifest."

#descr "Endowed with eyes of Onyx, Umbur was gifted power over the spectral realm. While his left eye remains to allow him to see the mortal plane; his right eye is ever peering into Tartarus, a most maddening fate to endure. Even so, he can evoke its power, and he may assume command of the husks that remain after his mighty blows."

#name "Ruby Paladin"
#descr "Harkoning to ancient times the stone-kin of DÃ»n have come to serve a sacred role in the federation. It's members are dwarves who have waived all ties to their clan, and through a sacred ritual where they shave all hair they are blessed with skin akin to marble and gemstone eyes. Those with eyes of ruby serve as leaders and are set to learn the incantations, while those with amber execute the order's will.
In the later age, the stone-kin have dwindled in number due in large to the change in values of the dwarf clans. In order to keep relevant, they don the finest armor produced in Blackforge, serving as the ultimate show of dwarven craftsmanship.
Stone-kin have strong natural protection and possess magical sight, but they are weak to cold. The paladin wield a mighty hammer capable of turning those it strikes into stone."
